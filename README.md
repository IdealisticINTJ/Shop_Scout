## Features

Effortlessly compare prices, review counts, ratings, and more from a variety of websites, providing you with comprehensive insights. Tailor your search experience with customizable parameters, including search terms, filters for highest/lowest price or review rating, and the ability to specify the number of top results. Benefit from multi-website support, allowing you to fetch and compare data from a minimum of five distinct comparison websites. 

[Currently supported e-commerce platforms](): **Amazon, Flipkart, AliBaba, Snapdeal, Myntra**.

The responsive web interface ensures a user-friendly experience, while backend caching optimizes performance by storing spot price comparisons for efficient retrieval during repeat searches. 
ShopScout is your go-to tool for making informed purchasing decisions with ease.

## Utilities

- [x] Consider data minimization by saving only the previous data and updating when necessary.
- [x] Notification via Whatsapp
- [ ] Best Deals Section
- [ ] A NPM Package ([ShopScout](https://npm.io/package/ShopScout))
- [ ] Discord Bot
- [ ] Telegram Bot

### Idea on Data Minimization:

Save new data only if something has changed, avoiding unnecessary hourly data storage.

Mathematical Estimation:

- In 1 year: n(products) * 24 * 365
- For example, with n = 100: 876k data points
- For n = 400: 3.5 Million data points
